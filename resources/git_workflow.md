Git Workflow
============

We follow some patterns to organize how to open branches and this is related with our workflow in `KanbanFlow`.

If you didn't read [Pull Requests](https://github.com/kmonline/guidelines/blob/master/resources/pull_requests.md), we recommend to read it first before understanding our Git Workflow.

## Introduction

First, to understand how we organize ourselves, you need to understand types of Swimlanes we have. In KanbanFlow each registered card has a number.

### User Story

For us, an User Story can take up to 5 business days of work. When we pull an User Story to work we have the following steps:

* Preparation
* Planning
* Under development
* Review
* Release

During `Planning` session, we write tasks that compound story. For tasks we also have steps to follow:

* TO DO
* In Dev (WIP)
* Dev Done
* Dev In Test (Deployed/Build generated and being tested by developer)
* In test (Deploy/Build generated and being tested by a tester or other developer)
* Test Done

Card types in this swimlane:

* Task (common task)
* Bug (issues generated by tasks in test phase)
* Unplanned (new tasks introduced during development phase)

### Out of Flow

Out of Flow is designed for small cards that can take up to 2 business days of work.

Card types in this swimlane:

* Task
* Bug (issues non-related with opened (under development) User Story)
* Tech debt
* Spike (study, PoC, analysis, etc)

## Branches

We work with a single stable branch: `master`. Everything that is merged into it, we assume that already passed in `Test phase` properly.

Now that you're familiar with `User Story` and `Out of Flow`, let's understand how each one reflect to our branches and accordingly to our Pull Requests:

### User Story

#### User Story card

First we create a branch using `master` as base with the following pattern:

* `dddd-name-of-story`

Where `dddd` stands for Story Card in Kanban Flow, check some examples of naming User Story branches:

* `897-finish-visit-in-offline-mode`
* `569-edit-expenses`
* `642-clustering-and-noise-reduction`

#### User Story task cards

Then we pull a card to work on in `KanbanFlow`, we ignore number of it, then we create a branch with the following pattern using story branch as base:

* `xz-describe-what-will-be-done`

Where `xz` stands for initials of developer, check some examples of naming User Story task branches:

* `wt-fix-check-for-existing-month-on-offline-creator`
* `lh-remove-newline-from-customer-address-in-csvs`

If you developed that change in pair programming, you can use both initials ordered alphabetically:

* `lh-wt-fix-airbrake-to-notify-everyone`

Note that you're able to open new branches and Pull Requests as you consider necessary on working in task. To decide that, always keep in mind how easy would be to review your code, so Pull Request will be your guide.
